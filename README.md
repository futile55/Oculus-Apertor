# Oculus - Apertor

Most of the accidents happen due to the driver feeling 
drowsy, while being on a long drive or on a highway.
Therefore to save those precious lives, the app comes to
the rescue. **Prevention is better than cure and certainly better
than being deceased.**
The app primarily detects the shutter of the eye and 
makes sure the driver keeps his eyes considerably open
during the ride.

Salient features of the app include:   

 * An app that prevent accidents while driving.
 * Forces the user to keep his eyes open.
 * Has an eye exercise if user is feeling sleepy.
 * Can send messages to contacts if an accident occurs.
 * Alerts the driver to keep his phone in-front of him for
 the app to be functional.
